## :hammer: Lean Management

[Inspired by Toyota’s production system, Lean Management is a management and work organisation method aimed at improving a company’s performance and, more specifically, the quality and profitability of its output.](https://www.manutan.com/blog/en/glossary/lean-management-definition-and-tools)

## :bulb: Definition

According to [Semaphoreci](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/cicd-pipeline)

> A CI/CD pipeline automates your software delivery process. The pipeline builds code, runs tests (CI), and safely deploys a new version of the application (CD).
> Automated pipelines remove manual errors, provide standardized feedback loops to developers, and enable fast product iterations.
