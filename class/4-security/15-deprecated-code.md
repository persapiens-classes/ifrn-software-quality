Deprecated Code
====

## :unlock: Definition

[The term deprecated refers to a functionality that still exists in software whose use is not recommended. A functionality that is deprecated is likely to be removed in the future hence it is not advisable to use it. Deprecated functionalities are usually replaced or updated with newer versions.](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/deprecated-vs-obsolete)
