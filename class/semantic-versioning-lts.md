Semantic Versioning and LTS
====

## :unlock: Semantic Versioning

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
3. PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

## :bulb: LTS (Long Term Support)

[Long-term support (LTS) is a product lifecycle management policy in which a stable release of computer software is maintained for a longer period of time than the standard edition.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support)


## :construction_worker: Task

- Identify if semantic versioning and LTS are available on two of the software components (libraries, frameworks, SO) of your software.

Create one ticket in your software to describe it.
